************************
What's new in MyHDL 0.11
************************

0.11.51
Class Based Design
==================
Initial code to enable true Class Based Design resulting in very
clean designs with little, most ofthen none, glue signals to interconnect
logic blocks


0.11.50
blocked intialisation of TristateSignals
=======================================
fixes issue #438

0.11.49
0.11.48
0.11.47
Verilog Skip zero mem initialisation
====================================
A specific vendor: Efinix limits initializing a memory up to 20000 entries.
This allows for Verilog (only) to skip generating the initial block setting all entries of a memory to zero

0.11.46
Removed support for Python 3.7
=============================
As Python 3.7 is EOL we decided to remove any related code

0.11.45
Initialisation of list of enum
==============================
fixed #428

0.11.44
Array of Enum in .vcd
=====================
fixed representation of an arrayt (list) of enums in the generated .vcd outpu 

0.11.43
OpenPort
========
Until now if you did not use an output port of a block you would get
a warning by MyHDL that the port was never read, but you would get a similar warning
in the (FPGA) synthesis tool. You can now specify an OpenPort() as the output signal. 
MyHDL will take care of this by not declaring that signal and commenting out any assigns
in the generated code

Constant Signal
===============
In stead of translating constants (Macro in C/C++) to magic numbers
you can now delare them as a constant and they will show up as a `constant`
in VHDL or as a `localparam` in Verilog
For the moment it has to be a constrained `intbv`
e.g.: 

0.11.42
A sub-minor version number
=========================
We introduced this and thought it wise to start off with 42 ...
It is the idea that this subminor number is incremented for every commit/merger
so we can give better support 

< 0.11.42
The `isasync` arguments
=======================

The `async` argument has been replaced with `isasync` to avoid
the Python 3.7 keyword conflict.
