Python Support
================

MyHDL supports Python 3.8 and above.
At the moment, core functions, cosimulation and Verilog conversion work perfectly.
However, there may be a few unresolved VHDL conversion bugs.

All users are encouraged to try out their existing projects and tests and submit bug reports if anything goes wrong.
